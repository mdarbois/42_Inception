# Inception

Fundamentals of docker and docker-compose. 
Creation of a LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack using Docker with the following elements:

- A Docker container with NGINX supporting TLSv1.2/TLSv1.3 for secure communication.
- A Docker container with WordPress + php-fpm for serving the application.
- A Docker container with MariaDB for the database.
- Two Docker volumes for storing the WordPress database and website files.
- A custom Docker network to enable communication between containers.
The LEMP stack will host a secure and efficient WordPress application, utilizing Docker's benefits of portability and component isolation.
